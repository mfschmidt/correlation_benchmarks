# correlation_benchmarks
Benchmark many languages and libraries for doing repeated correlations

This repository is a collection of simple scripts to do repeated correlations and determine how long each method takes.

To just run everything, clone the repository, then in bash:

    $ run_them_all.sh
    
Alternatively, you can individually run any of the executable scripts to benchmark a particular implementation of repeated one-out correlations.
