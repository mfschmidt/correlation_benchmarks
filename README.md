# correlation_benchmarks
Benchmark many languages and libraries for doing repeated correlations

This repository is a collection of simple scripts to do repeated correlations and determine how long each method takes.

To just run everything, clone the repository, then in bash:

    $ run_them_all.sh
    
This will take somewhere in the ballpark of 15-20 minutes to run, but will obviously vary with your machine.

Alternatively, you can individually run any of the executable scripts to benchmark a particular implementation of repeated one-out correlations.
